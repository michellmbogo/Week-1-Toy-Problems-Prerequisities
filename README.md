 # Toy Problems: JavaScript Challenges

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript challenges designed to build problem-solving skills and familiarize developers with fundamental programming concepts.

## Challenges
**Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator**


This function takes a student's marks as input (ranging from 0 to 100) and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

Grade A: Marks greater than 79.
Grade B: Marks between 60 and 79.
Grade C: Marks between 49 and 59.
Grade D: Marks between 40 and 49.
Grade E: Marks less than 40.

**Challenge 2: Speed Detector**


This program evaluates a driver's speed and determines if they are over the limit. Key features:

Speed less than 70: Outputs "Ok".
For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives 1 demerit point.
If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program outputs "License suspended".
Example:

Input: 80
Output: "Points: 2"
Input: 130
Outputs:"License suspended"

**Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator**


This program calculates an individual's net salary by taking the following inputs:

Basic Salary: The employee's monthly pay before benefits or deductions.
Benefits: Additional compensation provided by the employer.
The program calculates:

Gross Salary: Basic Salary + Benefits.
PAYEE (Tax): Based on Kenyan tax bands.
NHIF Deductions: 2.75% of gross salary.
NSSF Deductions: 6% of gross salary.
Net Salary: Gross Salary - (PAYEE + NHIF + NSSF).
